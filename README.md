# XVWA Vagrant with Ansible Provisioning

There may be some permission issues still that block some of the vulnerabilities, I plan on fixing these as I discover them by completing the exercises. If you find any corrections please let me know.

If you want to change any of the variables like the database name, root password, etc... You can do so in the `ansible_tasks/vagrant.yml` file.
